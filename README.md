### Quick Start

1. Run `npm i` to install package dependencies.

2. Run `cp .env.sample .env` to create the configuration file.
    > **NOTE:** Please make the proper changes in ".env" file. 
    >
    > \* For **sending e-mails**, you must create an account in [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com). Then, navigate to "Settings > API Keys" menu, generate a new key and change your config file using the generated token.
    >
    > \* For **using payments**, you must create an account in [Stripe](https://stripe.com). Then, navigate to "Developers > API Keys" menu, copy the Publishable/Secret keys and change your config file using these tokens. ** **You must set an account name; otherwise, it will not work**.

3. Run `docker-compose up --build` to set up a quick database. _** You can skip this step if you don't want to use Docker._

    > **IMPORTANT:** Before running above command, make sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. * It runs the **docker-compose.yml** file.

4. Run `npm run seed` to Seed data into the database.

    > This command creates a couple of products and the Admin user (Username: `admin@gmail.com` / Password: `password`).

5. Run `npm run start:dev` for starting the server.
